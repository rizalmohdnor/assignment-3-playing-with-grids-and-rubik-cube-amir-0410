# Assignment 2: Play with a 2x2 Rubik Cube
by 

**NAME**: Amir Arif Bin Rosli

**Matric ID**: 2116249

## Objective

1. Accept the assignment and make sure you have a copy of the code.
2. The code provide a partially working code.
3. Add the necessary faces of the rubik cube in the code.
4. Modify the logic for rotating the 2x2 cube.
5. Add buttons below the cube to create action buttons.
6. Create a simple 2x2 rubik cube application that allows the user to rotate the faces of a rubik cube. The code given doesn't work. You may have to read the code and complete some functions and add buttons.
7. Make sure to only submit your /lib folder and modify the readme to describe what was done. You must also include your name and matric ID in this readme file.

## Requirements:

Tips:
Make sure to look at https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/lists/grid-lists to get a hang of the flutter grid layout which is being used in the code.

What I have done:
1) Completed the Cube Layout: Added all six faces (Top, Bottom, Front, Back, Left, Right) with proper color grids.

2) Implemented Rotation Logic: Fixed the rotateTop method and implemented a new rotateBottom method to handle rotations dynamically.

3) Added Rotation Buttons: Included action buttons (Rotate Top and Rotate Bottom) to allow users to interact with the cube.

4) Improved UI: Organized the faces in a visually clear layout and ensured dynamic updates using setState.

5) Enhanced Code Modularity: Modularized face-building logic and made the rotation functionality scalable.
